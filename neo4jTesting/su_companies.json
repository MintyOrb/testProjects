In Nov 2015, NASA awarded MIS a contract to develop \"Archinaut\" (i.e., “Architecture-astronaut”) Technology, which is an in-space robotic manufacturing and assembly capability that will eventually enable very large structures to be manufactured in orbit. This means one day soon MIS could build giant antennas in space, for instance—bigger than could ever be launched—capable of delivering Internet to every smartphone on Earth. ",
