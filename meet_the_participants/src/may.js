Our two flagship schools, Nashville Prep and Liberty Collegiate, are among the highest performing 5% of public schools in the Tennessee and serve mainly disadvantaged students (over 80% economically disadvantaged and over 95% students of color).  Our oldest kids last year outperformed every school in the state in math - including the competitive magnet schools. \n\nRegardless of this success, we are tearing down our model and starting again.  Why?  Because we believe our scholars were being well prepared for the past, but not the future. Even the most innovative public schools we observe are merely teaching students the skills of today (e.g., we teach coding as a core subject, which is bold in education circles but utterly uninspiring when you consider most schools should have made this move decades ago). I want to participate in this program so that I can spend focused time thinking about what the future will look like, so that our organization can properly transform to prepare our students for that future.",

I wanted to be part of this movement and started my career at Testa Hurwitz where I worked with technology companies and venture capital funds. The best part of practicing law with VC funds and entrepreneurs was being part of the strategic conversations and not merely being relegated to the legal work.\n\nFast forward 12 years, I joined a life insurance company and immediately noticed that this industry has not been disrupted by technology despite the enormous opportunity.  Everything from operations to underwriting to investments has not changed since the 80s. Despite the vast amount of technology and medical advances, life insurance companies continue to rely on nurse physicals and underwriters to evaluate such physicals to determine underwriting decisions. Eventually technological will reach the life insurance industry (and financial services generally) and it\\'s going to completely change the way we do business.  I want again to be part of the conversation and a driver for change in the industry.",

I work with Creative HQ New Zealand, advising large organisations about the impact of exponential technologies, exponential organisations, and in the lean startup space, mentoring startups on customer engagement, lean startup methodology and invest-ability.\n\nI\\'m passionate about leaving the world a better place than I found it. I do this through my role as CEO of Read Me Stories (8Interactive) where we address the problem that 1/3rd of kids fail to learn to read in school, and 2/3rds never progress from \\\"learning to read\\\"​ to \\\"reading to learn\\\" - a problem of national significance in many countries around the world.\n\nIn 2005 I had the ultimate startup experience - sailing a small boat from San Francisco to New Zealand, departing SF in February, arriving NZ in December - an exponentially slow way to travel - using a decidedly non-exponential technology - but providing the opportunity to experience life in many small villages.",

I`ve started to work as a salesman on the city fairs, helping my father to feed the family. that was another good lesson, that helped me to accomodate in not friendly environment of georgian speaking ppl, while I was russian speaking and armenian by nationality. as a result - I killed all communication barriers inside and learned that every has to be respected and developed. when I was 13yo I got inspired with martial arts and physics&math. I`ve passed exams and entered in the most sophisticated math&physics school in former USSR. that were hard years of learning, creation and inspiration. I`ve leaded the team of my classmates, we`ve solved problems in physics and took loads of prises of Soros sponsored international olimpiads and www.iypt.org. after the graduation from that school I recieved free invintations from moscow state university and moscow physical and tech institute to enter. it was hard decision to decline, I was working that time and sponsoring my family. I was the one of the developers of the first bank swift system in Georgia, experiencing more that 1.5k USD salary in 16yo, while my father had $100 salary per month. I learn the responsibility lesson that time. it took me 4y of working and studying in Georgia. 20yo I left all my money to the family, took $500 and in 2days by bus I was in moscow. the adventures has began :-) I`ve started as real-estate agent. in 22yo I got earned my first $1MM, in 3yo my wealth was over $15MM, I started to invest in private equity - different industries. it was 2008 when my second kid has born, it was a lolevy son, it was a kicking-ass financial year. I`ve lost more than $40MM that year, it was another good teaching from life. my family support and breaking through inspiration pushed up... i`ve started everything from the beginning... just less than $1mm. in 5y I came back to $35mm, found good partners that now invest with me leveraging my capital. I`ve learned a lot in 15y of active entrepreneurship... the rainy days will follow you, but the sun is always inspring. dont stop, the shadow has a border. I dream of being involvled in game changing stuff. thats why I`ve started VC firm fully funded by myself and my partners. I`m playing all-in improving my experrience and god-feeling to find the right challenge for me as an entrepreneur. I`ve an idea that will rock the world of self-development and the current target is to find my future dream-team.",

Vertical social mobility can be delivered through education and support of young people to try to find their true potential. This is not just (highly) relevant for developing countries, but is increasingly highly relevant for the developed world where we see the emergence of a structural under privileged group in society with multi generational unemployment and unemployability. Long term I see this as a major threat to our society as it is eroding the societal fabric and underutilises the human capital. \n\nThrough education and training on the job, we can offer hope to people who otherwise only see hopelessness around them.",

I constantly find myself questioning how to improve what we do every day and to find a new way to be more efficient. I love mathematics, computers and everything that has to do with science.  During adulthood life separated me a bit of what I love and I dedicated my last 12 years in building my company that I am proud to say that is very successful. But I think that this way of thinking was the key for achieving all the good results of my life.\n\nI worked in many Internet startups when I was younger, later I worked in the energy business and I helped to develop a natural gas engine for trucks and now I own a logistic company who operates in Chile, Argentina, Peru and Uruguay. I will define myself as an entrepreneur but I want to focus my next years in science, and to get in touch again with the most advanced technologies in the world. I am currently investing and starting to work in a new company which turns satellite images into very accurate information for agriculture interest. http://www.s4agtech.com/",

My strategic recommendations, based on value chain analysis (in part, Porter & Christensen), have been considered so groundbreaking they have already been included in new Canadian TV policy, which fundamentally shifts the orientation of Canada\\'s TV system from national to global, and from investment to return on investment. Of 30,000 responses to CRTC\\'s 2014 national policy inquiry on the future of Canadian TV, I was one of 116 invited to testify (only 10 individuals), and the only individual to be personally named in the key decision on content (2015-86).  Recognition as a thought leader sparked a year of (ongoing) media & speaking requests (TV, print, online, conference), as reflected in my LinkedIn. However, the journey has just begun; much work is required to envision and implement inspired and future-oriented public policy, a challenge which will be faced globally by many nations.  I look to the synergy and energy of Singularity University to accelerate my inspiration and original thinking.\nI also teach Media Markets and Brand Management (to MBA\\'s and Creative Industries undergrads) and am faced daily with the exciting challenge of preparing young professionals for careers in many fields (including automotive, finance, health care), amidst the most profound shift in knowledge dissemination in 600 years, which has only just barely begun; as we know, software is ready to move on from media and continues to \\\"eat the world.\\\"  The Singularity is Near is on all my reading lists.",

As I have sold my latest company to Switzerland\\'s biggest media house, I recently started to open-up my mind again by travelling the world\\'s hotspots in terms of online businesses together with my wife and daughter. I came across Silicon Valley, Berlin, London, Bangkok, Shanghai and Beijing. \n\nDoing so, I realized that starting my next and maybe more global online business would be a consequental and thus not only fast-forward but also easy step. That\\'s why I decided that whatever I do next, it must tackle a bigger cause than just the next cool business case. Among others, one of the most inspiring developments happened after I had met Pascal Finette in Sept 2015 visiting SU. The talks there laid the foundation for me digging deeper and deeper into the space of artificial intelligence.

    "What is the Biggest Opportunity": "If we create effective mechanisms so people can invest directly in this process together with governments and professional investors through the capital markets and other efficient and transparent platforms, the objective of 1000% growth can be achieved quickly and it also would produce a strong awareness and alignment of interests between people, high impact entrepreneurs, governments and capital markets.\n I believe SU will provide knowledge tools and networking that will be instrumental in achieving the above mentioned goals",
    "What is the Biggest Problem": "I think Latinamerica needs that investment in projects that generate disruptive innovation via exponential tech multiply by at least 10x (from 600 M to 6 B)  in a short time to be able  to solve the great challenges that its 600 M habitants are facing.\n\nThe challenge is to work with government, exchanges, regulators, entrepreneurs, ONGs, institutional investors an researchers in designing an implementing a sustainable framework of regulation and incentives so investment in disruptive innovation can quickly become a mainstream asset class available to the public through established capital markets and other mechanisms like crowdfunding.",

I mentor young entrepreneurs and am excited to also pay it forward by influencing and contributing to innovation ecosystems, primarily in the area of acceleration, and linking Universities, talent and private industry sponsorship to support and increase entrepreneurial success. \n\nI was inspired by the themes in Salim Ismail\\\\\\'s book Exponential Organizations, and even more motivated after attending the recent Waterloo Innovation Summit. I have a lot to give back to the community and the next generation by finding a way to strengthen innovation ecosystems and pass on my own knowledge and experience, not only to individual entrepreneurs but to the larger players in these ecosystems that make a tangible vital difference to the future of exponential organizations. I want to make a difference and continue to contribute long after I retire. Now is the time to learn more through immersing myself among other diverse thinkers through connections like Singularity University, be a part of organizational transformation, and maybe start my own niche company in this space.",

My years at Bell Canada taught me many disciplines while teaching me to be disciplined. It set the stage for my entrepreneurial adventure in the establishment of a company that manufactures high performance doors.\n\nIn 2003, along with the original 6 employees, I started TNR Industrial doors. We live by our vision of working hard and having fun. We are now the largest provider of high performance rubber roll up doors in the world and the largest high performance door company in Canada. Our doors run at high speeds to conserve energy, have lifetime warranties on the main components and can be hit by vehicles and reset. They are popular in parking garages, manufacturing facilities, warehouses, mine sites, bus stations, office towers and airports. \n\nI grew up in Toronto, ON moved north to Barrie, ON with my husband, Denis Galbraith, and our 2 children, Courtney and Brett, when Denis was moved to establish a new wealth management branch for his firm. Barrie is a growing community where outdoor recreation is preferred and smaller companies flourish. It was the perfect place to find the skills to start the TNR adventure. \n\nI like to ski, golf, scuba dive, watch hockey and head north to the cottage with my family. As a family we are participants in our community whether it is local hockey, the United Way, Hospice Simcoe or community parks.",

    "What is the Biggest Problem": "We at Avira are already a well established brand in the Windows Antivirus software category in the German speaking countries. Our biggest challenge as of now is growing beyond the Windows Antivirus space ( given that Windows defender is a serious threat to the entire AV industry) and leverage the growing trends in the Internet of things. \nWe have very young leadership, but still all our initiatives are not bringing on the results as we expect and at the pace we think we should.",

I think it’s time to shift the focus back to purpose. That is why I have decided to take a 6 month sabbatical to explore. I hope to be given the opportunity to join the Singularity University EP program, to be surrounded by like-minded folks, so I can inspire and be inspired to change the world and to do bigger things. \n\nFor me personally, now is the right time. 10+ years in finance has taught me a number of very important and transferrable skill sets very well. To name a few - what it takes to run a global business, client management, people management & leadership, keeping a team focused toward a common goal, working with clients from various culture, how macro trends affect Wall Street and Main Street, investor mentality, etc. All of the above are valuable and applicable skills that any purposeful venture would need to make exponential changes to the world a reality. \n\nI do think the world will be better in the future than we think, as long as we remain hopeful, faithful and persevere in making sure that will happen. With technology, we are just getting started. I want to help building a better future. I really think I can help.",

I have seen tremendous advances in healthcare technology, but this has not translated to improved health of our population.  Particularly in rural areas, healthcare is becoming less accessible, not more.  Through policy work with the states, we see that there are huge opportunities to transform how health care is delivered and how health can be integrated and promoted in all we do at work, play, and home.  \n\nI believe Singularity University can broaden my perspective on the problems we face and open my mind to innovative and disruptive solutions.  Through access to medical education programs and state/federal policy forums, I believe that I can leverage this education to facilitate change.",

How to deal with this tension, how to project the impact of this tension on actual adoption rates, and what opportunities might exist in understanding this interface/tension better would all be of interest.",

    "Inspired by": "I\\'ve always been highly commited to solving relevant social challenges. Since my school years, I was always involved in leading student associations and engaging with social movements. In 1997 I was in my fourth year of law school at University of Sao Paulo and violence in Sao Paulo, my home town, had reached its peak. Most of the 12,000 people killed every year - 90% with a gun -  were youngsters from 15 to 24, the same age as the perpetrators. As president of the Student Association I\\'ve worked together with a group of students to launch the Sou da Paz (I am for peace) campaign. Sou da Paz rapidly grew, mobilizing several sectors of society, and was the first movement in Brazil for gun control. The campaign grew, became two years later an NGO and I lead this organization for 12 years. During this period, some of our results include changing the gun control legislation in Brazil to one of the most modern in the world; contributing directly to the reduction of homicides in the poorest neighborhoods of Sao Paulo at first, and then in the whole city (over 80% reduction, or 9,000 lives saved per year) in a decade and being of one the leading members of the coalition that made the UN approve it\\'s first legally binding international treaty to control the flow of arms (Arms Trade Treaty).\nHaving learned that it was possible, with almost no resources and not much experience, work with a group of very talented people to help solve a large problem, I\\'ve decided that it was time to tackle challenges in other areas. In 2011, I was invited by Jorge Paulo Lemann, one of the world\\'s leading entrepreneurs, to take his Lemann Foundation to the next level. The Foundation had only 6 people and a modest budget at the time. Although education was not my field, it was undeniable that it was the most critical aspect for Brazil\\'s future. In these past 5 years as CEO of the Foundation we were able to devise a new strategy, focusing on large scale, effective innovations that could really affect all of the 56 million public school students in the country. There is a long way to go, but having started from scratch, we have finished 2015 with 12 million unique users of our educational resources, have trained over 15,000 teachers and principals to be more effective in their classrooms and we have been leading a coalition that convinced the Brazilian government to create a high standards curriculum for all our kids. The organization has now a team of over 50 and the budget has multiplied by 12. I really feel I could learn a lot from the Singularity experience and maybe contribute a bit to the community by sharing some of our learnings and current challenges.",

    "Inspired by": "My background is in higher education and senior external relations. I have been working closely with the President and Deans of Harvard University for the past decade. My intense focus the last five years has been in the international realm specifically Latin America, with special projects in close collaboration with high-level principals from the public and private sector and also governments in the region.\n\nThis has inspired my vision and created a unique professional and personal profile which can contribute greatly to the diversity of the program and the cohort of participants. I have helped establish and raise resources for pivotal innovative programs. Examples range from on-line learning platforms such as HBX at Harvard Business School, to the establishment and growth of regional offices in emergent market countries such as Brazil and Mexico for Harvard, to funding special initiatives of the President. \n\nMy background has thus uniquely exposed me to a network of an amazing faculty and students, some of the world’s most noted thinkers and doers, at a leading research University.  This landscape is something for which I am grateful. Every day it is inspiring in a new way.  I would like to share what I have learned with others, and build on all the opportunity for new knowledge your program offers.  I have also been engaged at Harvard with our professional development programs in business, government, and education. Not only have I raised resources for these programs, but I have also been an enthusiastic participant.  Having already had exposure in professional development programs at Harvard, I am hungry for a fresh experience with inspirational new content.\n\nHere is a unique experience I would like to share with fellow participants. I recently imagined, executed and oversaw an extremely successful innovative private knowledge event, similar to the Aspen Institute or Davos, for one of the worlds’ leading entrepreneurs. In this capacity I managed and recruited over a dozen star faculty and top visionaries on content ranging from economics, technology and cyber security to medical ethics, social science, physics, and beyond, and oversaw the sponsor’s family and 200 privately invited guests who convened in Cambridge. The program even attracted participants like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, both of whom provided feedback the experience was wholly unique, energizing and exceeded their expectations. . The theme was the future of knowledge – how will learning evolve and what are the big ideas of the future? \n\nI am hopeful to be in attendance in May to learn share, and grow as much as possible. I am excited the environment, participants and content of Singularity will inspire my ideas. I am certain Singularity can help me reach and engage more people who are motivated by the top thinkers of today, and those of the future.",

    "Inspired by": "From my early childhood, I knew I wanted to be a physician.  By the time I walked through the doors of medical school, I knew that “doing well by doing good” was my life’s work.  I cherished my time in medical school – there really is no better place to learn life’s lessons, whether good or bad.  One of the most profound events in my life was the emergence of the HIV epidemic while I was in school and – when a colleague and friend died in my arms – gaining first-hand knowledge of how a diagnosis of HIV / AIDS at that time was truly a death sentence.\n\nIt was at this time that I realized: as a doctor, I could impact the lives of some…as a champion for the democratization of healthcare, I could impact the lives of many.  I left the medical field for the pharmaceutical industry with a goal of transforming HIV from a death sentence to a chronic, managed disease (and it has been); since that time, I’ve held leadership positions in big and small Pharma, Biotech and now Med Tech all with an eye toward diagnosis and treatments that cure or reduce the impact of the chronic, managed diseases of today.  \n\nUltimately, my vision for the future of healthcare is easy to say and harder to execute; today we practice “sickcare” where we mainly treat symptoms and not the underlying causes of illness.  Every day we are working toward a future where we prevent diseases altogether, detect them very early if one does develop and – finally – cure it before it impacts a patient’s life.  We are in the early stages of realizing this vision with enhanced / more widespread genomic testing, point-of-care diagnostics and personalized medicine; and although there is a long way to go, we’ve never been closer than we are today in making this a reality.",
