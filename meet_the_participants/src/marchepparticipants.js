I have always been amazed that the horses would do what I was asking despite the fact that they were 100x stronger than I am. I could not force them, they would only follow me if I would be decisive, respectful and fair to them. These have become my guidelines as a business leader.\n I have worked in emerging markets for certain periods of my career and have always been impressed how these markets have the drive and energy to advance from their situation. Solutions for large complex societal and business issues are found despite the lack of resources.Two key words: creativity and simplicitiy. I try to apply this also in my personal and professional life.",

    "Inspired by": "It seems odd that frequent childhood trips to Disney World sparked my lifelong interest in how technology will solve virtually all of the problems facing mankind in the future, but that is exactly what happened.  Like many kids my age, I was excited about Epcot Center, the new Walt Disney World park that opened in 1982.  The Future World segment of Epcot Center presented pavilions representing various ideas related to progress and how we will solve problems in the future.  My life was impacted immensely by imagining how human ingenuity and imagination could solve problems related to health and medicine, transportation, ecology, space, city planning, and food.  I saw the promises of the latest in technology (or rather, what we considered the latest and greatest back in the 80s) and how my life would be dramatically different as an adult than that of my parents and grandparents.  At that time, I had never heard of Ray Kurzweil.  I had no idea that the power of information technology was increasing exponentially.  I had never heard of nanotechnology, synthetic biology, or virtual reality.  I was just a kid having fun at Disney World and dreaming about what life would be like in the future.  As I became a teenager and young adult, I certainly did not have any solutions to the problems facing mankind, but I did always have a strong feeling of optimism that somehow technology would make everything better.  Several years ago, I became familiar with Ray Kurzweil, and I began reading about technologies that have the potential to make the dreams I had as a child a reality.  Instead of just thinking vague terms of \"some day\" and \"what if\", I was excited to start seeing the missing pieces of the puzzle falling into place.  For me, Singularity University  represents the other side of the coin that was created when I was just a child.  Instead of just being aware of the possibilities, I now know of a place where I can learn to make my vision of the future real.",

Working for an airline for 12 years gave me the opportunity to visit and work with more than 30 countries around the world. \nSince the association between LAN and TAM, LATAM Airlines group has become the major airline in Latin America. Last year I created in the company the first strategic design department and the first collaborative work space. Today I combine my work in LATAM Airlines with a contribution in R21 a Latin American sustainability foundation and with consultancy in strategic design and experience design for independent projects across Latin America.The different areas of my work are converging in one point: Latin America. I see in this region a unique opportunity to promote a sustainable development coming from its own heritage and values. In Latin America we value long-term relationships and we have a privileged closeness to nature. I dream to make a contribution to the world based on these values through design & education.",

    "What is the Biggest Problem": "I believe that today’s world is at a crucial moment in which we need to redefine the meaning of what we are and what we do.\nThe combination of population growth, increased consumption per capita, depletion of natural resources and growing human invasion into ecosystems, are leading to a sustainability crisis that could threaten the survival of our population. Also the rapid advance of new technology is reshaping the society, politics, commerce and culture. In that context current business models and practices, education methodologies and belief systems are becoming obsolete.\nIt’s necessary to take a deep dive into the value creation meaning. Today it is limited to economic profitability, and it’s not enough to solve the current problems. This complex content is a great opportunity to change from value creation models to shared value creation models. Organizations should think of themselves, expanding their horizons and incorporating a human-centered approach.\nI truly believe if we can make a stop, observe and understand earth and heaven order, like our ancestors used to do, we’ll learn a little more about how to live in synchrony with nature and do not try to beat it or go against it. We’ll learn about long-term’s cycles and systems. \nThe biggest challenge will be how to bring this approach to life, visualize it and spread valuable knowledge through actionable opportunities.",

We ensures a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity in our high voltage grid connecting the 41 million end-users in the market we serve. Currently the energy sector is facing various technological developments which will have high impact on the day-to-day energy sector. Examples are the integration of renewable energy in the grid, energy storage technologies, AI and big data. It is important for business leaders to understand which technology will matter to them, how those technologies could transform the existing business models, and how those developments influence the strategic decision making with regard to TenneT. \n\nA lot of new technologies are announced as a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"breakthrough\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" technology or promises to bring the society to a next level. Not every emerging technology will impact the society significantly. However some technologies do have the potential to disrupt the status quo – and will have enormous impact on the day-to-day live. We see a transition towards renewable energy due to the combination of stimulating governance and cost reduction of technologies. For example, Ramez Naam of your University shows the exponential price decline of solar power and energy storage technologies. \n\nThe rapid technological developments will transform the current business models. The traditional electricity value chain consists of generation-transmission-distribution-retail pathway in a one way direction. The introduction of customer-owned renewable energy generation, plug-in hybrid vehicles, energy new technologies and IT, will move power and information in multiple directions. Those developments enables new participants and new business models. For example, platforms are an upcoming trend. These platforms could link energy suppliers, service providers, device manufacturers, application developers and end users. The platform could lower costs of providing services by offering some level of standardization.\n\nTechnological developments and transformation of business models will influence the strategy of TenneT as well. TenneT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s investment plan for grid extension is around EUR 28 billion for the next 10 years. The question can be raised if we should invest the full amount in grid extension, anticipating upon the rapid technological developments. What is the role of grid connection in the future? Will electricity be more and more produced in a decentralised way? What will be the possibility that a complementary technology develops, which will take over the functions of the grid? It would be interesting to gain insights how the Singularity University looks at the current and future technological developments. And how would it be possible to construct a strategy as the speed of technological developments is tremendously as we speak?\n\nFor TenneT it is important to learn how to unveil and anticipate upon upcoming technological developments. TenneT is a larger company, which could not easily switch towards another strategy. We should ensure to not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"miss the boat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Therefore I am looking forward to gain more knowledge about how technologies develop, how business models could change, and how to develop sustainable strategies by joining this Executive Programme.",

I believe that emerging exponential technologies will be even more transformational for the continent. These technologies will create the opportunity for Africa to leapfrog to the latest technologies, in the process driving economic growth and uplifting the standard of living of people in the continent.\n\nHowever, the intellectual focus of the exponential technology community is largely the developed world. As a result, the importance and benefits of these technologies for places like Africa has not always received much attention. I hope to contribute this African perspective to the conversations of the SU community. Exponential technologies will change the world, but nowhere will its impact be as dramatic as in the poorest and least developed parts of the world.",

I quit and enrolled in an IT start up.\nI became a partner and spent 10 years fighting to have an innovative company with a vacation environment. But the investors pressure for results with no purpose led me to one more rupture.\nNow I`m a partner in a food and beverage company and I`m still trying to make it as a way to transform people, families and communities for a relevant social impact.\nIn parallel I donate my time to mentor start ups with social impact. I also study meditation, innovation, strategy, human behavior, philosophy and psychology.",

    "Inspired by": "I have lived and worked in Europe, Americas and Asia and gained a broader understanding of the world and its cultures. I have strong belief in the power of science and technology to address the pressing problems of the world. As a kid I was already passionate about learning about everything and had an urge to understand why things were the way they are. My catholic upbringing at a school run by missionary priests opened my eyes to social injustice, poverty, and lack of basic means. Though I was not particularly religious, I had an admiration for those that dedicated their lives to improve the lives of others.  I tinkered things and open up TVs, radios, electric and gas engines. At school I conceived and built from scratch a steam engine, that never managed to move... but the process of thinking and solving problems as they came was far more rewarding than the outcome. At the same time I loved creativity and the arts. I took on oil painting, then photography, amateur cinematography and music. I played the guitar in a pop-rock band since age 14 and wrote many of the songs. We were once on TV!\n\nWhile at school of electronic engineering in Barcelona in the early 90s, I partnered with a medical student who had a similar passion to use science to make good. We had seen many young kids affected by motorcycle accidents and wanted to solve paraplegia by implanting wires into the patient's muscles, controlled by an Intel 8080 chip, that would be programmed to send electrical impulses to move the muscles with a program that simulated walk. Needless to say that technology was not ready for our ambition and we both moved on. I went to the States to get an MBA from Haas at Berkeley, and later to work in consulting at the dawn of the internet in Silicon Valley. Best ever decision in my live.\n\nin the 2000s, at Cisco, I created and developed with Oxford University the Broadband Quality Index to help policy makers, service providers, media and analysts understand that broadband quality is critical for economic development and that it may be the largest equalizer in the 21st century. The study run for 3 years and was widely quoted, and later became Cisco Cloud index.\n\nScience has progressed to a point now that many of the dreams of my childhood and youth are feasible, and I want to be part of this.",

The centre has grown from a MENA  support oriented firm to one of the finest global innovation hubs within EY and the first and the only one among Big 4s that has an incubation centre in India. I always believed in developing  entrepreneurial capability and organization knowledge with the aid of innovative digital technologies and applying reverse innovation techniques at the right moment while building the organization.  Right from the beginning I also believed that the source to continuous technological innovation comes from the architecture of the organization, where free sharing of knowledge and swift reactions to shared knowledge form part of the foundations. I made the communication climate open and transparent so that, employees perceive that they are part of the process and organization, which helped in developing an efficient organizational clan and these teams focused on developing new ideas, service opportunities and client facing innovations targeting to serve MENA markets and globally. This innovative, high quality and high margin products developed within the innovation hub were taken globally at a lower price point.\n\nMy vision for the future aligns with EY’s vision of building a better working world. My vision is to develop positively disrupting innovations and sustainable solutions utilizing both internal and external talent and by following reverse innovation strategy. Through reverse innovation strategy my vision is to market and develop local talent within EY and help accelerate start-ups by involving them in multitude of projects and empowering them to develop better products in the future for EY.

Nothing appears to be immune from the impact of the growing global demand on our natural resources, the possibilities created by digital technology and the capture and analysis of mega data. Water, food, and energy security, and social interaction are looming as global challenges - the definition of haves and have-nots is being redefined. Education is transforming peoples\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' expectations and science is making us more aware of the issues and opportunities than ever. Furthermore, we already have enough data and analytical capability in the world to model what is happening. Yet many people, organisations and sectors appear to be sleepwalking into the future.  \n\nYet I am very optimistic about the future. I am excited by the growing investment in the education of our young people, and the ideas they have that transcend current paradigms. The combination of their values and imagination, technological innovation and quicker access to information is an extraordinarily powerful opportunity - for individuals, for communities and for the world. My fear is that I, we - the current generation of leaders, could inadvertently be the constraining factor rather than the enablers of this opportunity. It is for this reason that I remain hungry for information, ideas and people that test my thinking and push my boundaries about what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s possible so that I in turn can do the same for others and perhaps inspire them - especially this extraordinary young generation that follows.",

    "Biographic Sketch": "Introducing Maarten….I’m currently living in Amsterdam together with Ellen, my lovely wife and social entrepreneur, and our kids Koosje & Pelle. After I finished law school with a master in IT law, I joined the Dutch telecommunications incumbent in 2001. My objective was to learn all about internet and the technology behind it. The impact of technology on the daily lives of people is something I\\'ve always been fascinated about. \n\nIn Amsterdam Guidion has it\\'s HQ. I get to ride my bike to work every day! It’s a high growth company with an amazing culture. Which is very dynamic, entrepreneurial and all about happiness. I’ve been running the company as managing director / CEO for the last 7 years. Guidion helps consumers get the most out of technology in and around the house. Not only to let them lead a very comfortable life, but also to make it a happier and more sustainable one. What we do ranges from installing smart devices in homes to servicing the solar panels we\\'ve placed on roofs. \n\nAt Guidion we try to do everything in a different way. We are for instance the only company that for 100% works with entrepreneurs / freelancers. In 2015 we\\'re visiting over 600.000 consumers in the Netherlands where we are the market leader. A number that enables us to come up with alternative business models through data, customer insights and technology. Currently we\\'re preparing an expansion into other European countries. Our goal is to become an international leader in home installation services. \n\nGuidion has shown me the positive difference entrepreneurship can make. Entrepreneurship, technology combined with a social objective is a mix that in my perspective can be the solution for many of today’s big problems.",

    "Inspired by": "Over the last 7 years I`ve enabled Guidion as a company to grow from 2 mio till 50 mio in revenues. This alone might not add to the diversity. The way I´ve set up the business model does. Our business model is all about happiness and entrepreneurship. And so is my believe about how to create a better future.\n\nTo start with the latter (entrepreneurship): Guidion was and still is the only field services company in Europe (as far as i know) that works for 100% with freelancers. We believe that an entrepreneurial spirit ultimately leads to better and more efficient service for customers. When starting our company we had to break through a lot of skepticism amongst investors, clients and employees over our business model. Still today when going into a new sector or market we have to overcome their strong belief that only traditional models with employees will work. Our exponential growth and great trackrecord in terms of quality and efficiency has proven them wrong. \n\nAnd when it comes to happiness, we\\'ve (also starting 7 years ago) put this as the nr 1 aspect in how to build a great culture and in how to deliver great service. Positive psychology is at the core how we manage our people. This has led to a unique dynamic, extremely flexible and service-oriented culture. Where the happiness of each individual is what we care about, because happy people at Guidion will every day make the end-customer a little happier. Over the last 7 years i\\'ve become an even greater believer in the power of positively influencing your own happiness and by doing so influencing also that of the people around you. The evidence that is has led to great results are best experienced when visiting our Amsterdam office. I happily invite you over!",

Callaghan Innovation sponsored Salim Ismail coming out to address NZ firms on his recent trip to NZ.  \n\nIn addition, I chair several fast growing privately owned firms where adoption of innovative technologies will underpin their future success. \nI want my thinking challenged as while I am recognised as an innovative thinker and someone who sees both the opportunities and threats of emerging technologies to our performance as a nation and the performance of our firms I want my thinking, knowledge and insights augmented through the exposure to both the course material and the fellow participants. This will enable me to add greater value in my areas of responsibility. \n\nThe March 2016 course will fit fantastically and align with relevant significant  planning/ investments cycles for the organisations I am involved with. I would be extremely grateful if you could fit me into this course. My formal training was in science and technology and I have received a number of national accolades/awards recognising my contribution to business and in the areas of science and innovation.

What makes me different is that I\\'m willing to commit myself and the resources around me to effect change, and I think a lot about the steps it takes to make it happen.  To me, a better world includes nuclear disarmament, a healthier environment, incentives to innovate and respect for one another.  I believe that an important part of this begins by teaching kids about our natural environment and giving them hope that they will have opportunities to learn, innovate and push humanity further.    \n\nI work for 18 million working Canadians who contribute part of their pay cheque to Canada\\'s national pension fund (a $275 billion fund that is estimated to grow to $1 trillion by 2040).  At CPPIB I helped create and lead a team that invests in long horizon themes like Innovations in Healthcare (e.g., immuno-oncology and genomics) and the Mobile Generation (Millennials and their use of mobile for just about everything).  We spend a lot of time thinking about how to build exposure to themes that will play out over a 10 - 20 year period, and also think about how we need to refrain from making investments that could be disrupted by these themes. I think CPPIB can help make the world a better place by investing to make the future a better place.  In addition to my professional role, I am a volunteer board member for the Greater Toronto YMCA.  The \\\"Y\\\" provides subsidized childcare to 18,000 kids, community centres with programs for at-risk-youth and assimilation services for new immigrants.",

The first is access to education and the opportunities it created for me and the second is the success in continuously integrating and blending technology with business.\n\nI was not fortunate to belong to the “lucky sperm” club that Buffet described, but I was lucky enough to get access to good education through the support of hard working parents and generous sponsors. This access to education made me who I am today and I realize that my life would have been very different had I not been privileged with this access. This today is a topic that motivates me further and further. It drives my idea and purpose of success. It justifies working hard to be able to pay forward what generous sponsors did and allows me to give back and contribute to others education. In a region (MENA) that is characterized by trouble and high youth unemployment rates, I have made it my key goal, hobby and passion to help reduce the youth unemployment and skills gap and related poverty. I launched Skillpowerment.com which aims to match make organizations with youth for skill sharing. I am eager to learn, unlearn and relearn and find ways to create greater impact for Skillpowerment. I want it to be exponential and like Singularity to impact a billion people! \n\nEducated in both computer science and business I found great pleasure and success in speaking both languages. My career success has greatly been influenced by my ability to utilize the latest technologies to solve real life business problems. I also realize that my personal and my company’s future and relevance (InfoFort is the leading records management company in the Middle East and Africa) will depend on my ability to keep doing this and to even anticipate future technologies and disrupt my own industry and company before someone else does. Through Singularity education, I am certain that I will get insights and access learnings that will allow me to take InfoFort to the next level. And I want the next level to be exponential not linear. I want to accelerate the disruption of the records management industry and transform it.",

    "Inspired by": "According to Mckinsey, the size of the SME credit gap in the MENA Region (the amount of credit required for growth by small to medium sized enterprises that is unmet by the financial industry) is about USD 320 billion.  Today more than 90% of all bank credit is extended to large corporates.  SMEs, however, represent the backbone of the economy, and also provide most of the private sector employment.  However, SMEs are financially excluded from the world of finance, and as a result, are unable to grow properly and produce rapid employment opportunities.  In Jordan, for example, SMEs produce about 70% of private sector employment, but receive only 7% of credit facilities.  The remaining 93% of credit facilities go to the large corporates, which represent less than 1% of registered companies.  This \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'financial exclusion\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' is very unhealthy, and is making the rich richer, and the poor poorer.  \nMy objective for the past decade has been to develop an institutional capability at Jordan Ahli Bank that is finally beginning to close this SME funding gap.  More importantly, I plan to use this capability to support other banks across the region to also close their respective SME funding gaps.  The roots of instability in the Arab world are largely economic and related to unemployment.  In the world of finance, the silver bullet for job creation is closing the SME credit gap.  In theory, if this gap were closed, the MENA region will produce tens of millions of new jobs.  This will usher a new renaissance, with positive reverberations to be felt across our entire world.\nOur bank is finalising the deployment of the most advanced banking system in the world, to unlock wonderful digital capabilities.  We hope to leverage these abilities in our quest to close the SME gap. I look forward to engaging with SU faculty and executive students to figure out how to substantially accelerate these efforts, and to produce a finance revolution in the MENA region that will empower the middle class and clear the way for a new era of peace and stability.",

    "Inspired by": "I am an individual who is obsessed with learning and the practical application of the acquired knowledge. Academically I hold BSc, MM, MBA, and PhD/ JD degrees (University of Southern California, University of Warwick and California State University at Fullerton) and completed post doctoral research as a Fulbrite Fellow in Seville, Spain. My purpose in acquiring the aformentioned degrees was solely motivated by a deep interest in learning from specific individuals who had a proven domain expertise in their given field(s) and with whom I could satisfy my deep curiosity.\n\nMy first career was as a classical guitarist (masterclasses with Julien Bream, Andres Segovia, Oscar Ghiglia) and for a period of six years, I performed internationally with debut concerts in London, Paris, Beijing, Geneva, New York etc. My goal had always been to record a record in Abbey Road Studios  and after fulfilling this goal, decided that I wanted to learn about finance. My goal was to work in Eastern Europe in Privatization so after completing an JD/MBA, was hired by Ernst & Young ( and later Deloitte & Touche) to work in their Privatization and Utilities Group and lived for the next 8 years in The Czech and Slovak Republics. After eight years of being an employee, I decided to become a consultant and spent the next two years developing and financing a series of submarine fiber optic telecommunication networks. I was deeply interested in the technology of un-repeatered festoon systems and was able to spend time with a host of brilliant engineers who were developing cutting edge solutions to solve (amongst others) dispersion problems  for long haul wave division multiplexing. I made my first million dollars and then started my own company which ultimately failed due to the crash in the telecom industry. I next founded a company that was focused on providing risk management tools in the insurance sector. I loved working with our in house physicians and mathematicians in designing risk management metrics and associated products.\n\nIn 2008, I became financially independent, moved to a small island in the Grenadines and set up a foundation (www.ashbywindwardfoundation.org) to provide medical care (primarily OB/GYN) to the islands inhabitants. We build two state of the art Operating Rooms and performed 113 surgeries. I have always been fascinated with surgery and this venue (in addition to improving the lives of the local people) allowed me to bring in a host of brilliant surgeons (vascular, upper extremity etc) who were and still are some of my greatest teachers. In the last four years, I have invested in and restructured (not all successfully) companies in the mining, gas distribution, cloud based video surveillance and banking sectors\n\nAs can be seen from this short review of my personal and professional career, I have (and continue to have) an extremely diverse, rich and interesting life. My vision for the future is now entirely focused in the  development of two  specialized wellness communities on the islands where I live. \n\nI am hopeful that this synopsis of who and what I am will demonstrate a high level of commitment to pursuing of life of diversity, learning and giving. \n\n\n\nI",

Meeting other like minded and highly motivated individuals who are dedicated to seeking and solving obvious problems in complex environments.\nc. Gain domain specific knowledge abut cutting edge developments in solar technology and battery storage.",
    "What is the Biggest Problem": "I live on a small Caribbean Island whose economic base was agriculture. The land is extremely fertile (primary crops are nutmeg and cocoa) though there is an extreme aversion by the populace to work in the agriculture sector due to an association with slavery and farming. \n\nThe island imports 90% of its poultry and 75% of its vegetables.  The government and private sector(s) have tried to launch various agricultural initiatives without significant success. \n\nI  want to solve this problem by introducing low impact/high yield growing environments (vertical farming etc) and domain specific expertise and partners to solve this problem",

After the death of her father in 2008, she became President of the company.\n\n Since joining Droguería del Sud (DDS), María Luisa has been involved in several projects to improve their business practices.  In 1972, she developed an on-line ordering system for pharmacies which provided more efficient invoicing and stock control.  DDS was one of the first companies in Argentina to implement this type of system.\n\n In the last 20 years she has been involved in the opening of seven new branches of DDS throughout Argentina, which promptly grew to the lead positions in their own regions.  In 1994, she led the implementation of a state-of-the-art automated ordering system.  In 2006, the company successfully installed an ERP SAP in the main warehouse and all of the seven branches to further improve operational efficiency and productivity of DDS’s business processes.  The implementation was a big bang start-up; the old system was turned off and the new system started on the same day.\n\n In 1999, she was appointed director of the IFPW Board of Directors.  She is also a member of the Board and Director of Laboratorios Temis Lostaló, one the 25 top manufacturers in Argentina.  She participates on the Board of the Argentinean Chamber of Commerce, and in AEA (Argentinean Business Association).\n\n María Luisa received her degree in Business Administration from the UADE (Argentina University of Enterprises).  She likes to focus her attention on customer satisfaction through direct and personal relationships with them.  Droguería del Sud, S.A. is a family owned business and together with her three sisters, María Luisa is working very hard in developing the future of the company.",

    "Inspired by": "My background is primarily as a military officer.  I am a 1988 graduate of the US Naval Academy and have served 27 years in the US Marine Corps, 17.5 of those on active duty.  I am an East/Southeast Asia regional affairs officer and have spent significant amounts of time in the Asia-Pacific region in both military and civilian capacities.  (Of unique interest, during my civilian years, I worked in Hong Kong during the handover from British to Chinese control and experienced the many accompanying changes.)  In recent years, the military has focused me on Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran and I have done a tour of duty in Afghanistan.  My formal military training was in communications and information systems, but the last 13 years have focused me on bilateral and multilateral security cooperation, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, and operational/strategic planning.  I am currently nearing completion of an Executive MBA at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and in the course of that program I was exposed to Singularity University when David Roberts presented during a conference.\n\nMy personal and professional interest in economic development and technology have converged with the Kellogg education to focus me on the global problem of economic stability posed by the accelerating technological advancements.  The advance of the GRIN technologies is unavoidable and dramatic.  While these technologies greatly improve our quality of life, it appears that this “revolution” unlike previous revolutions, may not be a job-creating revolution.  It may be that middle class jobs are destroyed in the developed economies and not replaced with large numbers of “good” jobs.  In the developing economies, legitimate aspirations to climb to middle class incomes and lifestyles may be thwarted as manufacturing job creation slows when technology begins to replace developing world labor as it has in the developed world.  In the developed world, these changes will produce social and political instability.  In the developing world, these changes may produce social disruption, instability, and transnational and international security challenges.  I see the need for all leaders in the public domain to begin serious thought about how encourage the development of good jobs in both developed and developing economies all the while without limiting the economic and technological development that has so dramatically improved human life.",

I led the platform development for the All Source Analysis System (ASAS) for the DOD, DIA and CIA with Steve Jobs at NeXT Computers. I have created a variety of software tools for the analysis of future systems and operational impacts, including developing advanced systems for the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.

I have developed a very international profile thanks to experiences that brought me in many counties in Europe, Latin and Central America, North America, Asia, and Middle East. I live now in Turin with my beloved wife. My hobbies are sailing in the summer and skiing during the winter. My most favorite movie is James Bond (my favorites is “For your eyes only”) but all of them are good.  \n\nPersonal and professional traits: \nPassionate about intellectual challenges, I am logical, analytical and objectively critical.  I like long-range planning and strategic thinking and prefer to be in charge. I enjoy focusing on new ideas and like to think ahead making systematic efforts to reach my objectives on schedule striving for perfection. I tend to be intolerant and impatient about confusion and/ or inefficiency and can become tough-minded when I engage in problems that get in the way of reaching an objective. For this reason I prefer to work with frameworks that help peel the onion (from outside to inside) rather than working bottom up the details. As a matter of fact I believe that this approach helps me to come to decisions quickly and then allows me to lead others forward.  \nIn managing my personal and professional life I value systems and principles and apply them to most of what I do. I enjoy to “be part of”, to be involved in making decisions and to see that they are eventually implemented. I am a reliable person that enjoys to take charge and make sure things are done well.\nI enjoy to build organizations and grow people and with this grow personally, professionally and help others to be better.",

Part of that work involved setting up and helping run (and closing down) a cross-government innovation/design lab looking at how to dramatically improve the work of the public service. That experience helped me understand the current limitations of the public sector, and how it is being subjected to the same disruptive changes that the media, banking and education industries have been. The public sector is still very much an institution suited for an industrial age, rather than a digital one and needs to rethink how it operates and how it relates to citizens. I believe the Singularity University would help me better understand how that might be possible, and how the public service can better engage with future disruption and technological shifts that are coming faster and faster. In my work I have been described as a \\'scout\\' and believe I can add to the diversity of the community through my experience combining public policy, horizon scanning, design, and innovation.",

Moreover, tough me that great ideas are not necessarily easy to implement.\n\nSince that time and while at BofAML, as a personal investment I have been building a platform to change the way a specific large segment of securities trade in Brazil. Success will come from providing a technology to create transparency, efficiency gains and scalability in these securities.\n\nLeaving and studying the technology sector for the past few years has triggered a major curiosity for the current transformation the world is going through and how I can combine my background with innovative ideas.",

I flew 15 years with the US Aerobatic Team (won 20 medals), 2x US National Aerobatic Champion in two airplanes I designed and built myself after dropping out of Purdue Aeronautical Engineering School the beginning of my sophomore year, and have amassed the largest private collection of vintage aircraft in the World (over 165)!\n\nOn the \\\"woo-woo\\\" side, I\\'ve experienced OBE\\'s and have had the opportunity to explore and connect with other Realities.

I believe I am onto something that has the potential to change the world by helping raise the consciousness of this Planet.

Coming from a loving family that nurtured problem solving, encouraged dreaming big, and embraced failure, the \\\"power of innovation\\\" seed was thankfully incepted within me early on and it grew fast. I was brought up to appreciate interdisplinary knowledge and respect its magnitude. It is our only master key to the doors of a better future. Almost a decade back, I joined a great team in the United Nations Volunteer Program and started working on the UN Program on Governance in the Arab Region (POGAR). We explored how technology and businesses could be harnessed for the better good of society, and how development programs could have a positive effect on individuals and small businesses. I was ecstatic when I received the \\\"United Nations Human Development Award” for my efforts and contribution.That experience inspired me to keep pushing forward.\n\nI continue to be infuriated by the level of corruption and ethical decadence that surrounds us all in the Middle East. The levels of poverty and illiteracy are on the rise, and we have great natural resources and little clean technology innovation. I want to challenge the status quo and utilize technology to build social enterprises that can empower marginalized groups, alleviate poverty, enhance transparency and corporate governance. My dream, and my bet, is that social enterprises can be more competitive and will provide more growth opportunities than SMEs.",

Together with great cross-functional teams, we’ve built products for Mobile, Web and Desktop that helped tens of millions of users worldwide.\n\nBeing a natural born tech geek, I followed Electronics Engineering & Computer Sciences on my educational path - BSc & MSc degrees. My graduation papers and MSc research were conducted on FPGA implementations of natural computing algorithms.\n\nStarting my career as a programmer, I discovered early on my passion for thinking outside the engineering box, being focused on what customers want, what the market favors and, more importantly, how can I impact positively the world. That was an inflexion point for me as I shifted to product management and entrepreneurship.\n\nMy next big endeavors are to help Avira disrupt the online security industry and, as a side project, build a product that will make it easy for everyone around the globe to take more educated risks – from what they eat to how they live their daily lives.",

We focused on Security Robotics and wanted to move into General Robotic applications for home. There I could live my passion for Research and Development but unfortunately we did not succeed so I had to move on. \n\nI moved to Finland in 2010 and started as a Technical Sales employee at F-Secure anti-malware Company, responsible for partners and customers all over the world. Due to my interest in development I made some improvements to the product so I was given the opportunity to move into Product Management where I could lead two teams of developers. \n\nToday I am a Product Manager at Avira and I enjoy what I am doing. I love to convey the product vision and deliver lovable products to customers but in my free time I still work on software and electronic projects. I like to help people and I want to make a change in the world.",

Politics plays huge role in that regulation and that is why we cannot see so many changes even in most developed and digitalized countries. However I believe that it will change, observing what\\'s happening in other markets and in developed societies where life of products shortens and young generation demands more work freedom. Future of work is not one job for one company. Future is flexibility, and that must be managed better than today. If we have private doctor, private banker, private stylist -we will have private HR advisor. Future employment will be different , we will need our smartphone and finger to sign contract which will be managed by our private HR operator, too. The operator who will provide us with complex solution for trainings, employment, our career development and our final employers. However we will not be tied up by our employers. We will be able to work for many of them, change our job if do not like one and have permanent market visibility. Our final employer will also need flexibility and simplicity, he will have access to best of its needs, most talented people who could work on time sharing contracts, which will make work more effective. And at the end simple invoice payment, every tax, insurance, recruitment, payment will be done by its HR digital service supplier.",

From  forests to  oceans, from new megalopoles to small community, from start up to Fortune 500 company,  Sustainable developement is vital. For many reasons, I have a very strong family and personal background about nature protection (my grand father launched a national park in France in the 60s). I had the chance to live in Vancouver in the 90s when primary forest was being cut  :  I got even more aware of the sustainable challenge we are facing.  For 20 years,  I ve been travelling the world ans the 7 seas (80 countries) for business and leasure and I sadly saw year after year pollution and natural ressources destruction growing. Both my brain and my heart are concerned.\n\nI did small things at my level : volunteering at a neighbourhood council in Paris (plant trees project) , or chairing my building  community board with a sustainable agenda. At work, at Natixis AM,  I launch in 2009 a  green task force to reduce the company impact. In 2012, I contributed to launch a responsible investment subsidary.\n\nI would now like to contribute much more to this global challenge. And technological and science innovation can help a lot (Digital of course - i\\'ve been working on digital since 1998), And economy and finance, my current industry, can drive a lot sustainable developpement. And I think there huge innovation opportunities  in the finance industry to promote sustainable industry. SU would be a fantastic opportunity to help me into this direction.",

It\\\\\\'s my belief that the only way you can truly disrupt status quo is to take big swings and dream big. And it\\\\\\'s what I strive to do.",

    "Question 2": "What does a technology company look like in the future? I feel like innovation at its purest only exists where there isn\\'t hierarchy/bureaucracy to slow it down. As a company grows, it bloats, and becomes vulnerable, especially given the level of disintermediation provided by the internet. Will the future just be a combination of large corporations owning platforms, small innovators constantly entering/exiting the rat-race, and consumers?",
    "Question 1": "What is the balance between machine learning and human intervention (e.g. red flag follow-ups). How far can we push the boundaries of AI, and what are today\\'s limitations?",
    "Question 3": "If Uber had sought approval from regulators before launching, I\\'d still be waiting at airports for overpriced taxis. And I hear about Uber\\'s regulatory challenges, but nothing about Lyft. How do you balance being \\\"first\\\" and potentially breaking/bending antiquated laws, with not getting bogged down in legal nightmares and potentially being overtaken by competitors in the process?",

    "What is the Biggest Opportunity": "Inspiration. It\\'s easy to lose sight of real world problems that our technology is trying to solve, in favor of discussing quarterly metrics and dodging office politics, while drinking our own bathwater. Want to (a) get an unbiased view of what innovators think of GE, and (b) an understanding of what globally-impactful problems other people care about, to help keep me grounded, and put our own journey in perspective.",
    "What is the Biggest Problem": "While I love talking to Eric Reis about Lean Startup theory, the reality is that we\\'ve taken a Zero To One approach to our software play at GE. The evangelists of our platform would say that their Industrial Internet of Things play is an exponential leap, and as a company we\\'re probably betting the farm, but how do we know we\\'re right before it\\'s too late?",

    "Inspired by": "When I was 11 years old I wrote for Amnesty International and worked on a campaign to have released Mar Mar Lar Nwee (18) and Mar Sanda U (19) both of which were arrested in the 1988 Burma uprising led my General Brigadier Chit Swe.  They were detained in violation of Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; \\'No one shall be subject to arbitrary punishment detention or exile\\'.  \n\nI was new to Amnesty and had been supplied with a set of templates to use in the letter campaigns  typically writing to government leaders, the judiciary and alike asking for their release), but chose to go a different path.  \n\nI wrote politely describing myself as an 11 year old, curious about the world and not able to understand why Mar Mar Lar Nwee and Mar Sanda U were being detained.  I asked them (the recipient) to think about how they might meet the same curiosity in their own child (if they had one) and how they might explain the situation to them.  This was genuine and intentional as I wanted to stand out from the templates (that I suspect would be disregarded) but also appealed to the emotional side of the recipient.\n\nThree months later I received notification from the Red Cross that the two had been released.  There were others working on this campaign and I assumed (as I was by far the youngest in the group) incorrectly that everyone must have received the same notification and was able to update the group with the good news when we next met.\n\nCausality is always difficult to have certainty about in these circumstances and it is important to have humility and recognise there were others working on this campaign, but I was the only one to receive the notification which most likely means my writing had some relationship to the events.\n\nI took from this (at a very young age) the lesson that an individual has an huge capacity to influence and affect change even from afar, and that world problems that might be distant in geographic, proximity and experience are often closer than they appear.\n\nMy interest in the bigger picture has never died and only grown.  \n\nAt 20 I finished university and was recruited into Australia’s foreign intelligence services.  I enjoyed a first career working at the sharp end of that industry and in various technical and national security liaison roles with postings overseas.  \n\nI subsequently moved into financial services, working in the United Kingdom (Deutsche Bank and UBS), Switzerland (UBS) and Australia, National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia where I am now the Chief Information Security and Trust Officer and sit on a number of non-profit boards (including TheConversation, a media company: https://theconversation.com/ and CREST).\n\nI hold a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, an LLM (Masters of Law) and am currently studying a Graduate Diploma in Banking at the London School of Economics.\n\nI draw energy from and return it to creative and entrepreneurial people and am involved in many innovative and socially disruptive aspects of financial services and cyber security especially looking at the intersection of sociology, physiology and technology.  I also make a pretty good orange, cinnamon and vodka jam.\n\nI think we live in amazing times.",

However, in the last few years I have become more focussed on the role that financial institutions play in society, the opportunity they have to address regional wealth disparities, how they should contribute to tackling financial exclusion, and funding strategies for social entrepreneurs to help them become viable, sustainable businesses.\n\nI believe that the combination of new technologies, the \\'financial might\\' of banks, and a lot of creative thinking about what the future might look like could have a profound impact on building more sustainable, more diverse and more inclusive communities.",
